\begin{abstract}


Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health challenge, necessitating elderly behavioral monitoring for early detection. Existing approaches typically aggregate behavioral statistics, such as average sleep onset time and daily walking duration, resulting in the loss of crucial temporal behavioral patterns, such as repeatedly checking the same location, and missing anomalous episodes where early AD symptoms manifest. 
To address this limitation, we develop \sys, 
the first system designed to grasp personalized temporal digital biomarkers indicative of AD using LLM. 
First, we develop temporal models that identify coarse-grained behavioral segments defined within a four-dimensional space (CTMS: Circadian-Task-Movement-Social), where patients' behaviors from the videos deviate from normal baselines. 
Next, the identified segments are analyzed by a medical literature-augmented large language model (LLM) to precisely refine anomaly boundaries for extracting AD manifestation episodes, i.e., temporal digital biomarkers. 
Last, the LLM uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a dedicated medical knowledge base to reason about clinically relevant interpretations of the temporal digital biomarkers, which, combined with individual variability, guides the parameterization of temporal models, enabling continuous, closed-loop personalization.
We collected continuous activity data from 99 elders over four weeks per participant and conducted offline evaluation. Results show that cognitively impaired individuals exhibited 1.24× higher behavioral anomaly rates with statistically significant group separation (p<0.001), achieving 92.3\% specificity through personalized baseline adaptation. The sample activity sequences of elders and our implementation are available at \href{https://github.com/HermesRY/AD-Moments}{\texttt{https://github.com/HermesRY/AD-Moments}}.

\end{figure}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide with an economic burden exceeding \$1 trillion annually~\cite{WHO2024,ADI2024}. Early detection is crucial as cognitive decline becomes increasingly irreversible in later stages~\cite{Rasmussen2019EarlyDiagnosis,Porsteinsson2021Diagnosis}. Current clinical diagnostics rely on periodic cognitive assessments (e.g., MMSE~\cite{Folstein1975_MMSE}, CDR~\cite{Hughes1982_CDR}) or expensive neuroimaging (MRI, PET scans).
% , which miss gradual behavioral changes between visits and remain inaccessible for continuous monitoring~\cite{Folstein1975_MMSE,Hughes1982_CDR,wexler2023medicare}. 
These intermittent evaluations may fail to capture daily behavioral patterns where early cognitive symptoms first manifest.
Recent ambient sensing systems enable continuous behavioral monitoring for AD detection~\cite{Boyle2025Activity}, however, they have several major limitations. First, 
% current systems like ADMarker
statistics-based systems~\cite{ouyang2024ADMarker} lose  information of temporal patterns in patients' behaviors by aggregating behaviors into statistical features.
For example, they count total walking duration or average sleep time but might miss the sequential patterns revealing cognitive dysfunction~\cite{Grammatikopoulou2024SmartHomeAD}. Consider an elderly person who walks to a cabinet, pauses in confusion, and returns empty-handed (see example in Figure~\ref{fig:example}). 
Statistics-based approaches might consider this normal walking activity because the total walking time seems healthy. 
However, such anomalous behavioral patterns can be high-risk indicators for early AD, as executive dysfunction manifests more frequently in disrupted activity flow rather than activity counts~\cite{Rasmussen2019EarlyDiagnosis,kirova2015working,guarino2019executive}. 
% Second, a critical gap exists between sensing outputs and clinical interpretation for AD diagnosis. 
Second, most existing systems~\cite{Civitarese2025SERENADE} lack medical interpretation of sensing outputs, which might may cause edge models to either misidentify essential behavioral segments or recognize unnecessary ones.
% for AD diagnosis 
For instance, they may provide behavioral metrics like ``nighttime activity increased 23\% in monitoring dashboard'' but cannot distinguish whether this represents pathological wandering requiring attention or harmless insomnia that should be ignored~\cite{kamil2021detection}. 
Third, individual variability can significantly affect whether specific behaviors should be considered anomalous or normal, causing models trained on average behavioral patterns to fail to capture person-specific cognitive decline. 
For example, a night owl's normal 2am activity gets flagged as pathological wandering, while an early bird's genuine 4am confusion episodes are dismissed as normal behavior~\cite{populationdigitalhealth, peterson2017personalized}. 

% 1. cannot rely on statistics
% solution: find temporal DB from segments using LLM
% 2. do not know what the sensed pattern means, which can lead to recognize unnecessary or mis-recognize necessary behavior segments in edge models
% solution: use medical interpretation from LLM to guide/update edge models
% 3. individual variability can significantly affect the pathology of some behaviors (anomalous or not)
% solution: use individual variability to guide/update edge models

To address these challenges, we develop \sys, the first system that identifies personalized temporal digital biomarkers indicative of early AD in videos of daily living.
Our key insight is that \emph{human manifests signs of cognitive decline in not only activity statistics but also temporal behavior patterns.}
First, we develop task-specific models with temporal encoders that analyze the sequential relationships between activities. 
We propose a novel four-dimensional behavioral space (CTMS: Circadian-Task-Movement-Social) with multi-scale analysis that captures micro-level transitions (a pattern of \emph{``walk$\rightarrow$pause$\rightarrow$walk''} indicates forgotten intent), meso-level patterns (repeated unsuccessful task attempts), and macro-level disruptions (irregular circadian activity patterns) to identify coarse-grained behavioral segments that deviate from normal baselines.
% address the temporal information loss. 
% NExt, the identified segments are analyzed by a medical literature-augmented large language model (LLM) to precisely refine anomaly boundaries for extracting AD manifestation episodes, i.e., temporal digital biomarkers???????
% Last, the LLM uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a dedicated medical knowledge base to reason about clinically relevant interpretations of the temporal digital biomarkers, which, combined with individual variability, guides the parameterization of edge models, enabling continuous, closed-loop personalization. (need updated) 
Next, we integrate medical knowledge through LLM augmentation to analyze these segments and refine the anomaly boundaries. 
When the temporal intervals of cognitive symptoms are detected, the LLM extracts fine-grained video segments as AD manifestation episodes, which serves as temporal digital biomarkers for subsequent early detection.
Last, the LLM generates clinical interpretations through medical reasoning by retrieving relevant medical literature to contextualize observed behavioral patterns.
Based on accumulated evidence of individual-specific AD manifestation patterns, \sys dynamically adjusts CTMS encoder attention weights.
This bi-directional framework enables continuous adaptation to individual cognitive decline patterns, achieving personalized monitoring.
We collected continuous activity data from 99 elders over a four-week period per participant. Offline evaluation demonstrates that CTMS captures statistically significant behavioral differences between cognitively impaired and cognitively normal elderly (p<0.001).
\sys achieves 92.3\% specificity with significant clinical correlations between behavioral patterns and cognitive assessments (MoCA: p=0.041~\cite{Nasreddine2005MoCA}), validating the clinical relevance of temporal digital biomarkers.

\section{System Design}
\label{sec:design}

In this section, we describe the system design of \sys.

\subsection{System Overview}

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Overview of \sys. 
From the daily activities of elders, CTMS temporal model detect anomalous behavior segments that deviate from normal baselines.

\label{fig:system_overview}
\vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}
% \vspace{-1em}

%\sys monitors 22 activities of daily living (ADL) through a depth cameras, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:activities}. 
\sys analyzes 22 activities of daily living (ADL) of elders, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:activities}.
These activities span basic ADL (BADL) such as walking and eating, instrumental ADL (IADL) including cleaning and grooming, and social interactions (SI) like phone calls. 
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:system_overview}, \sys analyzes activity sequence through CTMS temporal encoders to recognize anomalous behavior segments that deviate from normal baselines. 
The activities are processed at three temporal scales: micro-level for immediate cognitive lapses, meso-level sequences for task execution patterns, and macro-level for circadian disruptions.
Then, a medical literature-augmented LLM helps extract precise AD manifestation moments from the detected behavior segments to identify temporal digital biomarkers, outputting refined timestamps and clinical interpretations via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Lastly, these interpretations, combined with accumulated individual variability patterns, dynamically adjust CTMS temporal encoder attention weights (e.g., $\alpha_{c}$: 0.25$\rightarrow$0.40) for personalization in a continuous, closed-loop fashion.

% Each activity category manifests decline at different disease stages and contributes to specific behavioral dimensions. 


% The bi-directional design enables collaborative intelligence: edge models cast a wide net to detect potential anomalies efficiently, while LLM refines these detections to extract precise AD manifestation episodes and guides personalization by adjusting dimension attention weights based on accumulated behavioral evidence. This creates an adaptive system that focuses on person-specific decline patterns while maintaining consistent evaluation criteria.

\subsection{Multi-Scale Temporal Behavior Patterns}

Cognitive decline manifests across different temporal scales, from momentary confusion to long-term behavioral changes. 
In this section, we describe our hierarchical multi-scale framework in which \sys recognizes temporal behavior patterns of the users.

%\noindent\textbf{Micro-scale} (5-30 secs). We analyze immediate activity transitions that signal cognitive lapses---such as rapid ``walk$\rightarrow$stand$\rightarrow$walk'' patterns~(indicating forgotten intent) or ``take$\rightarrow$stand$\rightarrow$put'' sequences~(revealing object manipulation confusion). 
\noindent\textbf{Micro-scale} (5-30 secs). We analyze immediate activity transitions that signal cognitive lapses. For example, rapid ``walk$\rightarrow$stand$\rightarrow$walk'' patterns that may indicate forgotten intent, or ``take$\rightarrow$stand$\rightarrow$put'' sequences that could reveal object manipulation confusion.
These brief moments often represent the earliest signs of executive dysfunction, where the individual loses track of their intended goal mid-task.

%\noindent\textbf{Meso-scale} (1-10 mins). We examines task completion logic, identifying repeated unsuccessful attempts or premature task abandonment that signal executive dysfunction. 
%For instance, an individual might attempt to prepare tea multiple times within 10 minutes, each time forgetting a crucial step or becoming distracted. 
\noindent\textbf{Meso-scale} (1-10 mins). We examine task completion logic, identifying repeated unsuccessful attempts or premature task abandonment that signal executive dysfunction. For example, repeated cycles of similar activities within a short time window may suggest perseverative behavior or task confusion.

%\noindent\textbf{Macro-scale} (hours-days). We track circadian rhythm stability, meal timing consistency, and activity distribution patterns that deteriorate with disease progression. 
%This includes phenomena like sundowning, where confusion increases in late afternoon, or complete reversal of sleep-wake cycles~\cite{Khachiyants2011Sundown,Musiek2015Sleep}.
\noindent\textbf{Macro-scale} (hours-days). We track circadian activity stability and activity distribution patterns that deteriorate with disease progression. Phenomena like sundowning and sleep-wake cycle disruptions are commonly observed in cognitive impairment~\cite{Khachiyants2011Sundown,Musiek2015Sleep}.

\subsection{CTMS Behavioral Space}

In this section, drawing on extensive neuropsychological literature, we define a four-dimensional behavioral space (CTMS) that captures early cognitive decline progression and AD manifestation patterns. 
Each dimension represents a distinct cognitive function that deteriorates progressively in AD patients.

%\noindent\textbf{Circadian Rhythm Dimension (C)} captures the regularity of daily routines and sleep-wake cycles. Cognitively normal elderly maintain consistent patterns with regular meal times (typically 7-8am, 12-1pm, 6-7pm), predictable sleep schedules (10pm-6am), and concentrated daytime activity. Cognitively impaired individuals progressively lose this regularity, exhibiting nighttime wandering, irregular eating patterns (meals at 3am or skipped entirely), and fragmented sleep with multiple awakenings. 
\noindent\textbf{Circadian Activity Dimension (C)} captures the regularity of daily routines and sleep-wake cycles. Cognitively normal elderly typically maintain consistent daily patterns with concentrated daytime activity and regular sleep schedules~\cite{Musiek2018RestActivity}. Cognitively impaired individuals progressively lose this regularity, exhibiting nighttime wandering, irregular activity patterns, and fragmented sleep with multiple awakenings.
We define the Circadian Disruption Index (CDI) to quantify the regularity as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\text{CDI}\, = \,\text{JS}(\mathbf{P}_{observed}^{24h},\; \mathbf{P}_{baseline}^{24h})
\end{equation*}
where JS denotes Jensen-Shannon divergence~\cite{lin1991divergence} between observed and baseline 24-hour activity distributions, and $\mathbf{P}^{24h} = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_{24}]$ represents the probability distribution of activities across a day.

\noindent\textbf{Task Completion Dimension (T)} analyzes the logical flow of goal-directed activities. 
For example, healthy task execution follows predictable sequences (taking an object, walking to destination, and placing it appropriately), while cognitive impairment disrupts this logic through forgotten objectives (starting to make coffee but abandoning mid-task), perseveration (repeatedly checking the same cabinet), and task substitution (beginning one task but completing another). 
We define the Task Incompletion Rate (TIR) as the proportion of sliding subsequences that fail to match any learned template:
\begin{equation*}
	ext{TIR} = \frac{1}{N_{sub}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{sub}} \mathbf{1}[\text{similarity}(S_i, T_{best}) < \theta_{complete}],
\end{equation*}
where $S_i$ are subsequences extracted by a sliding window from the observed activity sequence and $N_{sub}$ is the total number of subsequences. Similarity between a subsequence and a template is computed by sequence alignment:
\begin{equation*}
	ext{similarity}(S, T) = \exp\big(-\text{DTW}(S, T) / \tau\big),
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	ext{DTW}(S, T) = \min_{\pi} \sum_{(i,j) \in \pi} ||s_i - t_j||^2.
\end{equation*}
In our implementation the Dynamic time warping (DTW)-based alignment is the reference method; a GPU-friendly pooled-cosine approximation is available as an optional fast path for large-scale experiments.

% Implementation note: for practical, GPU-friendly implementations we provide a configurable fast approximation
% that replaces costly DTW computations with a pooled-cosine similarity on learned representations.
% In the reference (paper-faithful) implementation we use DTW to compute sequence alignment costs; in
% the GPU-optimized runtime used in experiments the pooled-cosine path is enabled by default for speed
% (it can be disabled to force DTW-based similarity when strict replication of the paper's DTW is required).

%\noindent\textbf{Movement Pattern Dimension (M)} examines spatial navigation efficiency and purposefulness. 
%Normal movement shows direct paths between functional areas (bedroom$\rightarrow$bathroom$\rightarrow$kitchen) with clear objectives. Cognitively impaired individuals exhibit increased randomness, repetitive pacing (walking the same circuit 10+ times), getting lost in familiar spaces, and spatial disorientation (looking for bathroom in kitchen). 
\noindent\textbf{Movement Pattern Dimension (M)} examines spatial navigation efficiency and purposefulness through activity transition patterns. Cognitively impaired individuals may exhibit increased randomness in activity sequences, repetitive behavioral cycles (walking the same area 10+ times), and disrupted spatial-temporal patterns.
We define the Movement Entropy (ME) to measure the pattern randomness as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\text{ME} = -\sum_{i,j} P(i \rightarrow j) \log P(i \rightarrow j)
\end{equation*}
where $P(i \rightarrow j)$ represents the transition probability between activity states $i$ and $j$, computed over sliding windows.

%\noindent\textbf{Social Interaction Dimension (S)} monitors engagement quality and communication patterns. Cognitive impairment progressively impairs social cognition, leading to withdrawal from conversations, delayed responses to questions (>5 seconds), inappropriate social behaviors, and shortened interactions (<2 minutes vs normal 10-15 minutes). 
\noindent\textbf{Social Interaction Dimension (S)} monitors engagement quality and communication patterns. Cognitive impairment progressively impairs social cognition, potentially leading to withdrawal from conversations and shortened social interactions.
We define Social Withdrawal Score (SWS) to quantify this decline as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\text{SWS} = 1 - \frac{\text{duration}_{current} \times \text{frequency}_{current}}{\text{duration}_{baseline} \times \text{frequency}_{baseline}}
\end{equation*}





\subsection{CTMS Temporal Encoders}

CTMS temporal encoders extract four dimensional behavioral patterns from activity sequences of elders.

\noindent\textbf{Circadian Activity Encoder} uses a 3-layer Transformer with learnable positional encodings for time-of-day, capturing periodic patterns:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{h}_{cr} = \text{TransformerEncoder}(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P}_{time} + \mathbf{P}_{day})
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times d}$ is the activity embedding sequence, and positional encodings are:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{P}_{time}[t, 2i] = \sin(t/10000^{2i/d}), \quad \mathbf{P}_{time}[t, 2i+1] = \cos(t/10000^{2i/d})
\end{equation*}

\noindent\textbf{Task Completion Encoder} employs a BiLSTM to encode observed activity sequences and performs cross-attention against full-length prototype templates. Task templates are stored as prototype sequences
\(\mathbf{M}_{task} \in \mathbb{R}^{K\times L\times d}\) (each template has length $L$). Cross-attention between the encoded query and the template set is implemented with multi-head attention:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{h}_{tc} = \text{MultiHeadCrossAttn}\big(\text{BiLSTM}(\mathbf{E}),\;\mathbf{M}_{task}\big).
\end{equation*}
Similarity for TIR is computed by aligning sliding subsequences to the templates (DTW) and aggregating the fraction of subsequences below a completeness threshold.

%The \textbf{Movement Pattern Encoder} models the home as a spatial graph where rooms are nodes and transitions are edges, using Graph Attention Networks with 3 layers:
% % \begin{equation*}
%$\mathbf{h}_{mp} = \text{GAT}(\mathcal{G}_{spatial}, \mathbf{E})$,
% % \end{equation*}
%where $\mathcal{G}_{spatial} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$ represents the spatial connectivity graph, and attention coefficients are:
%\begin{equation*}
%\alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i || \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j]))}{\sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_i} \exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i || \mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_k]))}
%\end{equation*}
\noindent\textbf{Movement Pattern Encoder} models activity transitions as a graph where activities are nodes and sequential transitions are edges, using Graph Attention Networks:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{h}_{mp} = \text{GAT}(\mathcal{G}_{activity}, \mathbf{E})
\end{equation*}
where $\mathcal{G}_{activity}$ represents the activity transition graph.

\noindent\textbf{Social Interaction Encoder} combines 1D temporal convolutions with statistical features:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{h}_{si} = \text{CNN1D}(\mathbf{E}_{social}) \oplus [\mu_{duration}, \text{freq}_{count}, \text{response\_time}]
\end{equation*}

We adopt heterogeneous encoder architectures across CTMS dimensions to better align with the intrinsic characteristics and temporal scales of each behavioral process, to balance representational fidelity and computational efficiency required for continuous monitoring and analyzing.
These dimension encodings are fused using a multi-head self-attention module. We stack the per-dimension encodings into a matrix
\(H=[\mathbf{h}_c;\mathbf{h}_t;\mathbf{h}_m;\mathbf{h}_s]\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times d}\) and apply multi-head attention:
\begin{equation*}
H_{attn},\;A = \text{MultiHeadAttn}(H,H,H),
\end{equation*}
where $A$ contains attention weights of shape (heads × 4 × 4). Per-dimension fusion weights are obtained by averaging attention across heads and queries:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_d = \frac{1}{H}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\frac{1}{4}\sum_{q=1}^{4} A_{h,q,d},
\end{equation*}
and the fused representation is
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{h}_{fused} = \sum_{d=1}^{4} \alpha_d \cdot H_{attn}[d].
\end{equation*}



\subsection{AD Manifestation Moment Extraction and Temporal Digital Biomarker}

Our system employs normal baselines for consistent anomaly detection. During the training phase, we process continuous data from cognitively normal participants to establish fixed population norms representing healthy elderly behavior:
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{\mu}_{d,normal} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{h}_{d,i}, \quad \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{d,normal} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\mathbf{h}_{d,i} - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{d,normal})^2}
\end{equation*}
where $N$ represents aggregated behavioral samples from normal participants. These baselines remain fixed throughout the monitoring period, serving as the reference for detecting cognitive impairment.

For each monitored participant, we compute CTMS dimensional anomaly scores as deviations from these fixed normal baselines:
\begin{equation*}
\text{Anomaly Score}_d = \frac{||\mathbf{h}_d - \boldsymbol{\mu}_{d,normal}||_2}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{d,normal}}
\end{equation*}

The combined anomaly score integrates all dimensions with personalized attention weights:
\begin{equation*}
\text{AD Score} = \sum_{d=1}^{4} \alpha_d \cdot \text{Anomaly Score}_d
\end{equation*}

Anomalous segments are detected when the combined score exceeds a population-based threshold:
\begin{equation*}
\text{Anomalous Segment} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if AD Score} > \tau_{normal} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $\tau_{normal}$ is derived from the normal patient distribution.

The model implemented for the experiments follows the descriptions above. Per-dimension baselines (means and standard deviations)
are computed from the cognitively normal cohort on the full-dimension encodings $\mathbf{h}_d$ and used at evaluation time to
produce per-dimension anomaly scores via the $\ell_2$ deviation normalized by the baseline standard deviation. Task similarity
is defined by sequence alignment (DTW) over sliding subsequences; for large-scale GPU experiments an optional pooled-cosine
approximation is available and can be toggled in the runtime. The movement encoder operates on an activity-type transition
graph (one node per activity type; 21 activity nodes in our taxonomy) where edge weights are normalized transition counts and a
Graph Attention Network produces movement embeddings. Social features use temporal segments of interaction (frequency is the
count of social interaction segments, duration their mean), which are concatenated with CNN-derived temporal features. During
training a supervised classifier head (binary cross-entropy) is used to learn a discriminative output; anomaly scoring is
performed at evaluation using the per-dimension vector baselines described above.
When CTMS temporal model detects potential AD manifestation episodes, \sys dynamically adjusts the fusion weights of four-dimensional encoders according to individual behavioral patterns to enable personalization, identifies precise AD manifestation episodes as temporal digital biomarkers.



\subsection{Dimensional Weight Personalization}

The personalization process optimizes dimension attention weights based on individual patterns while maintaining normal baselines:

\noindent\textbf{Phase 1 - Pattern Discovery (Week 1):} Initialize with balanced dimensional weights. \sys analyzes every detected anomalous segment to identify which dimension contribute most to the individual's cognitive pattern. For instance, one participant might show 70\% of AD manifestation episodes related to task completion while another shows distributed patterns across all dimensions.

\noindent\textbf{Phase 2 - Weight Adaptation (Weeks 2-3):} Based on accumulated evidence, dimension weights are adjusted to reflect individual patterns:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_d^{(t+1)} = \alpha_d^{(t)} + \eta \cdot (\alpha_{d,adaptation} - \alpha_d^{(t)}), \quad \eta = 0.1
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha_{d,adaptation}$ represents recommended weights based on observed AD symptom manifestation distributions. Weights are normalized to ensure $\sum_{d=1}^{4}\alpha_d = 1$.

\noindent\textbf{Phase 3 - Personalized Monitoring (Week 4+):} With stabilized personalized weights, the system efficiently monitors the individual's specific vulnerability patterns. This approach ensures that while all participants are evaluated against the same healthy baseline, the system adapts to focus on each individual's unique manifestation of cognitive decline.

\section{Preliminary Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Data Collection \& Experiment Setup}

We collected continuous activity data from 99 elderly participants in their homes over a four-week period, during which all participants lived their normal daily lives. A Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth camera (DCAM710) was used to capture daily activities in a privacy-preserving manner. The camera provides a wide field of view $69^{\circ}$H $\times$ $51^{\circ}$V with a resolution of 640 $\times$ 480 pixels, and an effective sensing range of 0.35–4.4\,m. A NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX edge device (8-core ARM CPU, Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS) was used for local data collection and preprocessing. The depth camera and Jetson NX were integrated into a compact box (Fig.~\ref{fig:layout}) and installed at a height of 1.5–1.8\,m in the primary activity areas of each participant's home for four weeks.
For ADLs, we used the same lightweight model as in ADMarker~\cite{ouyang2024ADMarker}, consisting of an eight-layer 3D-CNN that converts depth video streams into structured activity sequences. Patients with AD and MCI who have not received
an MRI test within one year are suggested to do a free MRI
test, while the MRI test is voluntary for cognitively normal
subjects. Then, the neuropsychologist will give the final diagnosis results of the enrolled subjects by combining the
results of the face-to-face interview and MRI scan.
To ensure accurate cognitive status labeling, most participants underwent clinical assessments, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)~\cite{Nasreddine2005MoCA}, Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI)~\cite{Zarit1980ZBI}, Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS)~\cite{Loreck1994DSS} and Fluency Assessment of Speech (FAS)~\cite{FAS}, conducted within six months of data collection.
Among the 99 participants (33 cognitively normal (CN), 32 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 34 with AD), ages ranged from 61 to 93 years with a balanced gender distribution. Following standard dementia research conventions~\cite{Petersen2001MCI, Aisen2010ADNI}, the MCI cohort was stratified by severity: 12 participants with early-stage MCI (EMCI) were grouped with CN, while 20 participants with late-stage MCI (LMCI) were grouped with AD. This produced a clinically meaningful binary classification of 45 CN versus 54 cognitively impaired (CI), enhancing statistical robustness while aligning with established stratification practices.
All data collection was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the authors' institution. For the preliminary results presented in this paper, we analyzed data from 68 participants whose recordings were sufficiently complete for reliable temporal analysis; the remaining recordings were excluded due to frequent sensor downtime and disrupted temporal continuity. Among these 68 participants, 26 were CN and 42 were CI. We used CN participants to establish behavioral baselines by computing the mean ($\boldsymbol{\mu}_{d,normal}$) and standard deviation ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{d,normal}$) for each CTMS dimension, and evaluated the system on the remaining CN and CI participants through offline analysis.
To establish robust baseline statistics and evaluate generalization, 50\% of CN participants (n=13) were selected for baseline computation, reserving the remaining CN participants (n=13) and all CI participants (n=42) for testing. This configuration enables evaluation of the system's ability to detect deviations from normal behavioral baselines in held-out participants.
Model training and evaluation were conducted on a workstation equipped with an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. The CTMS encoder uses a 128-dimensional embedding space, trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 64 and learning rate of 2e-4. For medical interpretation, we employed the LLaMA-3-70B model augmented with a medical RAG system.

\subsection{Dimensional Behavioral Analysis}

% Our framework analyzes behavioral patterns across the CTMS dimensional space to identify characteristic signatures of cognitive decline. Figure~\ref{fig:violin_analysis} and Table~\ref{tab:dimensional_stats} present the distribution and statistical analysis of the four CTMS dimensions between CN (n=13) and CI (n=42) groups in the test set.
% Social Interaction demonstrated the most pronounced directional trend (Cohen's $d$=-0.19, $p$=0.533), with CI participants displaying lower social engagement scores (-0.22±0.45) compared to CN individuals (-0.12±0.58). This pattern aligns with clinical observations of social withdrawal in cognitive impairment~\cite{Shafighi2023SocialIsolationAD}. Movement Pattern showed a modest effect (Cohen's $d$=0.10, $p$=0.642), while Task Completion ($d$=0.05) and Circadian Activity ($d$=-0.03) exhibited more subtle variations between groups.
% Importantly, the heterogeneous pattern of effect sizes across dimensions substantiates our multi-dimensional design philosophy: distinct behavioral domains exhibit varying sensitivities to cognitive decline, and their complementary integration yields richer insights than any single dimension alone. While individual dimensions show overlapping distributions, a characteristic of real-world behavioral data with high inter-subject variability, the CTMS framework leverages their collective patterns through learned temporal dynamics to achieve robust classification performance. This dimensional analysis provides interpretable insights into which behavioral aspects contribute most strongly to the model's decision-making process, enhancing clinical utility and trustworthiness of the automated assessment.

\subsection{Temporal Activity Pattern Recognition}\label{subsec:temporal}

Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_patterns} presents the hourly temporal distribution of behavioral anomalies detected by our CTMS framework across the daytime period (9:00-19:30). The adaptive anomaly detection mechanism, calibrated to flag the top 10\% of activity windows based on multi-dimensional behavioral deviations from CN baseline patterns, reveals distinct temporal signatures between cognitive groups.
CI participants exhibited moderately elevated anomaly scores compared to CN controls, with a 1.24× higher mean score across all hourly windows (CI: 0.0104 vs. CN: 0.0084). Notably, 16 out of 42 CI subjects (38\%) demonstrated detectable anomalies during the monitoring period, compared to 4 out of 13 CN subjects (31\%), indicating that a substantial proportion of cognitively impaired individuals exhibit measurable behavioral irregularities captured by our framework.
The temporal analysis reveals complementary peak patterns: CN individuals show their highest anomaly concentration in the late evening period around 19:12, while CI participants demonstrate their peak activity disruption earlier at 18:12—approximately one hour earlier. 
%The shaded regions in Figure~\ref{fig:temporal_patterns} highlight periods where CI anomaly rates exceed CN baseline, with notable divergence during mid-to-late afternoon hours (15:00-18:00). This temporal window may represent a sensitive detection period when cognitive load from accumulated daily activities begins to manifest as behavioral irregularities in individuals with cognitive impairment.
The framework's ability to localize temporal patterns of behavioral deviation provides clinically interpretable insights that could inform targeted intervention timing and personalized monitoring strategies.

\subsection{Temporal Digital Biomarker Classification}

Table~\ref{tab:classification} presents comparative performance across three approaches: (1) ADMarker baseline~\cite{ouyang2024ADMarker} using statistical aggregation, (2) \sys without personalization, and (3) our full system with personalization.
ADMarker's binary AD detection achieved F1=0.333 with 25\% sensitivity, demonstrating the limitations of count-based statistical methods that lose temporal sequential information crucial for detecting cognitive decline. 
%Our \sys framework addresses this through learned temporal dynamics that capture behavioral patterns invisible to daily statistical summaries.
\sys without personalization achieved high sensitivity (97.6\%), effectively capturing most CI cases through global baseline thresholds. With personalization, \sys demonstrates substantially improved specificity (92.3\%) by adapting to individual behavioral profiles, achieving statistically significant group separation (p<0.001). Personalized baselines help reduce false alarms by considering each person's normal behavior.
Furthermore, our temporal pattern analysis (Section~\ref{subsec:temporal}) revealed that CI individuals exhibit distinctive temporal signatures with 1.24× higher anomaly rates overall. The window-level analysis captures fine-grained behavioral disruptions during afternoon-to-evening transitions (15:00-18:00), providing complementary discriminative information that enhances the CTMS's ability to distinguish pathological changes from normal inter-individual variation.


\subsection{Clinical Correlation Analysis}

To validate the clinical relevance of our temporal digital biomarkers, we examined associations between behavioral dimensions and standardized clinical assessments across 45 test subjects (11 CN, 34 CI) with available medical records (Table~\ref{tab:clinical_correlations}).
Analysis revealed that the Social Interaction dimension demonstrated significant correlations with multiple clinical measures. Notably, Social Interaction correlated significantly with cognitive function as measured by the MoCA (r=0.31, p=0.041), suggesting that passively monitored social behavioral patterns align with cognitive status captured by traditional neuropsychological testing. This relationship was further strengthened when examining a composite clinical score integrating multiple assessment instruments, which showed a stronger correlation with Social Interaction (r=0.37, p=0.012). The moderate effect sizes (r=0.31-0.37) are consistent with established digital biomarker research~\cite{Kourtis2019}, where passive monitoring typically provides complementary rather than redundant information to traditional clinical assessments. 
%The significant association between social behavioral patterns and cognitive function aligns with clinical observations that social withdrawal often accompanies cognitive decline, and demonstrates that CTMS-derived features capture clinically meaningful aspects of disease manifestation without requiring explicit cognitive testing.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\noindent\textbf{Digital Biomarkers.}
Digital biomarkers have emerged as promising tools for continuous cognitive monitoring, offering objective measures derived from digital devices and sensors~\cite{Piau2019_DigBiomarkers,Qi2025DigitalBiomarkers}. These biomarkers capture behavioral patterns through smartphone usage~\cite{Dagum2018_DigitalBiomarkers,Nguyen2023_KeystrokeBiomarker}, gait analysis~\cite{Cepukaityte2024_GaitReview}, speech characteristics~\cite{Lin2020_VoiceBiomarkers,Noto2024_SpeechAD,Robin2021_SpeechCognitiveImpairment}, and activity monitoring~\cite{Chinner2018_DigitalAssessmentCognition}. However, existing approaches rely heavily on statistical feature extraction and lose the temporal information that reveals transition cognitive lapses characteristic of early AD.

\noindent\textbf{Temporal Patterns.}
AD manifests through progressive deterioration in cognitive functions that exhibit distinct temporal behavioral patterns~\cite{jack2010hypothetical,Jack2013_DynamicBiomarkersAD}.
%Executive dysfunction disrupts the ability to plan and sequence complex tasks, leading to characteristic temporal logic violations~\cite{Satler2017_PlanningAD}. 
 %Early-stage patients show subtle timing disruptions in daily routines~\cite{Mckniff2025_SubtleInefficiencies}, while advanced stages exhibit severe temporal disorientation including repetitive behaviors and sundowning~\cite{Thomas2022_WanderingSundowning,Reimus2025Sundowning}. 
 Despite medical literature of temporal sequences, current sensing systems lack systematic approaches to capture these patterns, motivating our temporal activity semantics approach.

\noindent\textbf{LLMs in Healthcare.}
% Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in healthcare applications, particularly in clinical reasoning and medical text analysis~\cite{Singhal2023ClinicalLLMs,Kwon2024_ReasoningLLM}. LLMs achieve expert-level performance on medical licensing exams~\cite{nori2023gpt4med,Singhal2025ExpertLLM} and assist in diagnosis generation~\cite{McDuff2025LLM_Diagnosis}. However, their application to continuous behavioral data in smart health has received limited attention.
Large language models show strong performance in healthcare tasks such as clinical reasoning and medical text analysis~\cite{Singhal2023ClinicalLLMs,Kwon2024_ReasoningLLM}. They can reach expert-level scores on medical exams~\cite{nori2023gpt4med,Singhal2025ExpertLLM} and support disease diagnosis~\cite{McDuff2025LLM_Diagnosis}. However, their use for continuous behavioral data in smart health remains limited.



\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present \sys, the first vision-based system that leverages LLM to detect personalized temporal digital biomarkers indicative of cognitive decline in AD. We collected real-world data and conducted offline evaluation, demonstrating strong performance in identifying AD manifestation and providing a sensitive, clinically meaningful measure of cognitive impairment.
While \sys provides promising preliminary results, it has not yet undergone detailed clinician review of each detected moments and the LLM interpretation. Instead, our validation relied on clinical assessment scores and the distinction between CN and CI groups to demonstrate the system's utility. Future work will involve close collaboration with clinical experts to validate \sys through clinical trials and real-world evaluation for practical healthcare applications.
