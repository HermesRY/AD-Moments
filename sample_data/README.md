# Sample Action Sequence Dataset

This folder is generated by `utils/build_sample_dataset.py`.

Contents:
- `subjects.json` — Anonymized subject metadata (anon_id, label, gender, age, status, scores)
- `sequences.jsonl` — One JSON per line: {anon_id, month, sequence: [{ts, action_id}], counts}
- `action_map.json` — Mapping from action folder names to integer IDs
- `summary.json` — High-level dataset summary

Notes:
- Subjects are reindexed from 1..N (anon_id) based on sorted normalized subject IDs.
- Each file under a subject's action folder is treated as one action event at the timestamp in the filename.
- Sequences are aggregated per subject per calendar month.
