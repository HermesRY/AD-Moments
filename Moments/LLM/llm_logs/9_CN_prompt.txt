You are an expert clinical neuropsychologist specializing in Alzheimer's Disease assessment.

**TASK**: Analyze temporal behavioral patterns for Patient #9 (Diagnosis: CN) and provide personalized weight adjustments.

**BACKGROUND**:
We use a Temporal Digital Biomarker (TDB) system that measures 6 cognitive domains through passive monitoring:

1. **Behavioral Diversity** (0-100): Measures variety in daily activities (higher score = more impaired)
2. **Temporal Regularity** (0-100): Measures predictability of activity timing
3. **Perseveration** (0-100): Measures repetitive, stuck behaviors
4. **Activity Pattern Consistency** (0-100): Measures hour-to-hour variability
5. **Daytime Energy Distribution** (0-100): Measures circadian rhythm disruption
6. **Social Engagement** (0-100): Measures social interaction levels

**PATIENT DATA** (3 weeks):


Week 1:
  - Behavioral Diversity: 72.8/100
  - Temporal Regularity: 100.0/100
  - Perseveration: 0.0/100
  - Activity Pattern Consistency: 63.3/100
  - Daytime Energy Distribution: 100.0/100
  - Social Engagement: 25.8/100

Week 2:
  - Behavioral Diversity: 54.9/100
  - Temporal Regularity: 100.0/100
  - Perseveration: 51.3/100
  - Activity Pattern Consistency: 100.0/100
  - Daytime Energy Distribution: 100.0/100
  - Social Engagement: 25.8/100

Week 3:
  - Behavioral Diversity: 15.9/100
  - Temporal Regularity: 100.0/100
  - Perseveration: 50.8/100
  - Activity Pattern Consistency: 18.5/100
  - Daytime Energy Distribution: 100.0/100
  - Social Engagement: 25.8/100


**INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Analyze the temporal patterns across 3 weeks
2. Identify which cognitive domains show the most consistent impairment
3. Determine if there's a trend (stable/worsening/improving)
4. Adjust weights to emphasize the most clinically relevant domains for THIS patient
5. Provide clinical interpretation and recommendations

**OUTPUT FORMAT** (JSON only, no additional text):
```json
{
  "most_impaired_domains": ["domain1", "domain2"],
  "temporal_trend": "stable/worsening/improving",
  "adjusted_weights": {
    "diversity_impairment": 0.XX,
    "temporal_impairment": 0.XX,
    "perseveration_impairment": 0.XX,
    "activity_impairment": 0.XX,
    "daytime_impairment": 0.XX,
    "social_impairment": 0.XX
  },
  "clinical_summary": "2-3 sentence summary of patient's cognitive profile and key concerns",
  "recommendations": [
    "Specific recommendation 1",
    "Specific recommendation 2",
    "Specific recommendation 3"
  ]
}
```

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- Weights MUST sum to 1.0
- Focus weights on domains with consistent elevation (>40) across weeks
- Provide ONLY the JSON output, no additional text
