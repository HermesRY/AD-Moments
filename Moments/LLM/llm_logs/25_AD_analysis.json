  "clinical_summary": "Patient #25, diagnosed with AD, exhibits severe and stable impairment in Temporal Regularity, indicating profound disruption in daily routine predictability. Significant fluctuations in Activity Pattern Consistency suggest inconsistent self-regulation. A concerning trend of increasing social withdrawal is observed, despite recent improvements in Daytime Energy Distribution.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement highly structured daily routines with clear visual schedules to support Temporal Regularity and reduce variability.",
    "Develop flexible care plans that can adapt to fluctuations in Activity Pattern Consistency, providing support during periods of increased variability.",
    "Actively encourage and facilitate structured social engagement opportunities to mitigate the observed social withdrawal and maintain social connections.",
    "Monitor Daytime Energy Distribution for sustained improvement, and investigate potential interventions contributing to recent positive changes."
