  "clinical_summary": "Patient #20, diagnosed with MCI, exhibits severe and persistent impairments in temporal regularity, activity pattern consistency, and daytime energy distribution, indicating significant disorganization of daily routines and circadian rhythm. A consistent mild impairment in social engagement is also noted. Encouragingly, the severely impaired domains show a trend of slight improvement over the two-week period.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement highly structured daily routines and utilize environmental cues to enhance temporal regularity and activity consistency.",
    "Conduct a thorough evaluation for underlying factors contributing to severe circadian rhythm disruption, such as sleep disorders, medication effects, or environmental factors.",
    "Explore targeted interventions to encourage and facilitate increased social engagement, such as participation in structured group activities or regular family interactions.",
    "Continue passive monitoring with TDBs to closely track trends in the most affected domains and assess the efficacy of interventions."
