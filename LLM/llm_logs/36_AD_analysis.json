  "clinical_summary": "Patient #36 exhibits severe and consistent disruptions in fundamental temporal organization, including maximal impairment in temporal regularity and activity pattern consistency. A concerning rapid deterioration in circadian rhythmicity, as reflected by the significant worsening in daytime energy distribution to maximal levels, indicates a progressive decline in behavioral orchestration.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Initiate a detailed sleep-wake cycle assessment and intervention, including light therapy or medication review, given the severe daytime energy distribution impairment.",
    "Develop and strictly implement a highly structured daily routine, emphasizing consistent timing for activities, meals, and sleep, to support temporal regularity and activity pattern consistency.",
    "Caregiver education on managing behavioral disruptions related to circadian dysregulation and guidance on optimizing the home environment for routine adherence."
