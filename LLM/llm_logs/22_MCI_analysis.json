  "clinical_summary": "Patient #22 exhibits a concerning and rapidly worsening cognitive profile over two weeks, marked by maximal rigidity and repetitive behaviors (Perseveration, Temporal Regularity), a severe reduction in daily activity variety (Behavioral Diversity), and profound circadian rhythm disruption (Daytime Energy Distribution). This indicates a significant decline in executive function and behavioral regulation, escalating beyond typical MCI progression.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Expedite a comprehensive in-person neuropsychological evaluation to precisely characterize the extent and nature of cognitive deficits and confirm the severity of decline.",
    "Engage with family or caregivers to provide education on managing extreme behavioral rigidity, perseveration, and sleep-wake cycle disturbances, exploring strategies for environmental structuring and routine modification.",
    "Liaise with the patient's primary care physician to review current medication regimens and consider pharmacological interventions for severe sleep-wake dysregulation and behavioral symptom management.",
    "Implement structured, therapist-guided activities (e.g., occupational therapy) focusing on reintroducing novelty and flexibility to daily routines to mitigate worsening behavioral diversity and perseveration.",
    "Maintain intensive TDB monitoring, potentially increasing frequency, to closely track the efficacy of interventions and identify any further rapid changes in behavioral patterns."
