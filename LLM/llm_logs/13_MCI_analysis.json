  "clinical_summary": "Patient #13, diagnosed with MCI, presents with a stable pattern characterized by severe, pervasive impairments in temporal regularity of activities and significant circadian rhythm disruption, reflected by consistently maximal scores in these domains. There is also a persistent reduction in behavioral diversity, with moderate to high impairment. While social engagement and perseveration remain robustly unimpaired, the marked disorganization in daily timing and activity variety are primary concerns.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Conduct a comprehensive medical review for potential contributors to circadian rhythm disruption (e.g., medication timing, sleep disorders) and optimize sleep hygiene.",
    "Implement a highly structured daily schedule emphasizing fixed wake/sleep times, regular meal times, and pre-planned activities to improve temporal regularity and daytime energy distribution.",
    "Introduce novel and engaging activities through therapeutic intervention (e.g., occupational therapy, cognitive rehabilitation) to enhance behavioral diversity and reduce monotony."
