  "clinical_summary": "Patient #17, diagnosed with MCI, exhibits a concerning pattern of widespread and worsening behavioral impairments. Core deficits include persistent severe disruptions in temporal regularity and circadian rhythm, coupled with significantly reduced social engagement (impairment score 74.2/100). The emergence of perseverative behaviors and a sharp decline in behavioral diversity over three weeks suggest progressive cognitive decline, warranting close monitoring and intervention.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Conduct a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to further characterize cognitive deficits and rule out other contributing factors to the observed decline.",
    "Implement structured daily routines and environmental cues to support temporal regularity and circadian rhythm, potentially involving light therapy or chronotherapy to mitigate disruption.",
    "Develop an individualized social engagement plan, including facilitated group activities or structured interactions, to combat isolation and stimulate cognitive function.",
    "Monitor closely for further progression of perseveration and behavioral diversity issues, considering behavioral strategies or pharmacological options if symptoms escalate."
